# FastRender clippy configuration
#
# This file configures clippy linting for the FastRender project.
# Run with: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Complexity limits
# Increase from defaults as layout algorithms can be complex
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30
type-complexity-threshold = 500

# Avoid certain names
# Prevent variable names that shadow common items
disallowed-names = ["foo", "bar", "baz"]

# Documentation
# Require documentation for public items
# This is enforced via rustdoc, not clippy config

# Arithmetic side-effects
# Be more permissive than default for graphics calculations
# arithmetic-side-effects-allowed = true  # Requires nightly

# Allow certain types to be passed by value even if large
# For example, tiny-skia types are designed to be passed by value
# pass-by-value-size-limit = 256  # Requires nightly
