w3.org grid render fixed: grid layout now falls back to stacking children when Taffy reports zero-width grid items, forcing containers to fill the available width; added env logging FASTR_LOG_GRID_ROOT/FASTR_LOG_GRID_CHILDREN. Added w3.org to fetch_pages targets. Regression `grid_children_are_laid_out_even_when_taffy_reports_zero_width` guards layout of grid children; local patches previously under /tmp/w3-grid-patches.

Render pipeline now decodes cached HTML with proper charset sniffing: fetch_pages stores the response Content-Type alongside each cached HTML (.html.meta), render_pages decodes bytes via the shared html::encoding helper (BOM/header/meta/default Windows-1252), and fetch_and_render reuses the shared decoder instead of its local copy. cloudflare.com timeout still outstanding; latimes.com now renders in ~27s at 1200×800 with current defaults.
Cloudflare render perf fixed: web font loading filters to the page’s codepoints (skipping unused @font-face ranges) and web font HTTP timeout is 10s; FASTR_RENDER_TIMINGS now reports css_parse/style_prepare/style_apply. cloudflare.com renders in ~12s at 1200×800 instead of 70s+.
Inline split guard: TextItem::split_at now bails out on non-char-boundary offsets (avoiding UTF-8 slice panics) with regressions for mid-emoji and `previous_char_boundary_in_text`; marker baseline/list-style-position/ellipsis regressions landed upstream. Split-at safety now returns None on non-character-boundary offsets (no silent clamping).
render_pages CLI now accepts --accept-language (default en-US,en;q=0.9); HttpFetcher uses the provided value alongside User-Agent when fetching linked assets, and usage/help logs the chosen header.
fetch_pages cache writes are now centralized: HTML caching writes optional .html.meta sidecars via a helper, and tests cover meta persistence/removal; charset sniffing coverage unaffected.
fetch_and_render now reads .meta sidecars for file:// HTML inputs (e.g., cached pages) and passes the cached Content-Type through decode_html_bytes; added a regression ensuring Shift-JIS HTML decodes via the meta charset.
Aligned fetcher user-agents: exported DEFAULT_USER_AGENT in resource.rs, fetch_and_render now sends it on HTTP requests, and fetch_pages uses the same Chrome-like UA instead of the old compatible string. Deduplicated DEFAULT_USER_AGENT after rebase; trimmed an unused MixBlendMode import in display_list_renderer_test.
Hyphenation breaks filter out non-char-boundary offsets; itemized run splitting validates UTF-8 boundaries; shaping clusters clamp to UTF-8 boundaries with regression coverage. Split-at safety now returns None on non-character-boundary offsets (no silent clamping).
HttpFetcher follows redirects (up to 10), sends Accept-Language by default (DEFAULT_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE exported), and retries misreported Content-Encoding by falling back to identity (`fetch_http_retries_on_bad_gzip`).
fetch_pages accepts --accept-language overrides, treats empty HTTP bodies as errors (regression added), reports failed URLs in summary, and supports --timings for per-page fetch durations. render_pages/fetch_and_render also accept --accept-language and --timings flags; logging includes UA/viewport/scroll/output.
latimes.com fetch/render previously timed out at 60s; rerendered successfully (~27s) after UTF-8 split fixes (also renders ≈72s at 1200×800 after earlier panic fix). cloudflare.com renders in ~12s after webfont/timeouts adjustments.
HTML parsing disables scripting so <noscript> fallbacks are parsed/renderable; regressions ensure <noscript> content in <head> is preserved. CLI flags for prefers-reduced-{data,motion,transparency} supported across tools.
github.com render appears dark but matches site design; inspect_frag shows hero text/buttons at ~y=200.
Wikipedia portal: base_url/meta fixes + jsl10n-visible injection on html/body yield centered portal with assets loaded (PNG ~121KB). `fetch_bytes_uses_base_url_from_meta` regression added; task closed.
Fixed nowrap text-overflow with outside markers; added regressions for outside markers, start-side ellipsis, and image markers. Adjusted text_align_justify_expands_word_gaps test to assert all inter-fragment gaps expand under justify spacing.
Unitless zero parsing fixed; calc/min/max/clamp parsing supports numeric properties (opacity/z-index/order) with regressions. Order property added to KNOWN_PROPERTIES; non-integer calc orders ignored per spec. Container queries respect inline-size without requiring block dimension (optional logging via FASTR_LOG_CONTAINER_QUERY).
Added yahoo.com and nasa.gov to fetch_pages targets; yahoo/nasa renders heavy (timeouts at 60s; yahoo completes ~113s under higher timeout). Added mix-blend-mode display-list regressions.
Booking.com fetch returns empty body; fetch_pages now errors instead of caching zero-byte responses. Failed URLs reported in summary. fetch_pages/fetch_and_render support --timings; render_pages per-page logs UA.
Rendered pages revealed openbsd.org blank due to dropping positioned children when using layout_block_child; fixed by laying out positioned_children there and added regression `absolute_children_inside_block_descendants_are_laid_out`. openbsd.org now renders (PNG ~32k colors). CNN render completes with split_at guard (render_pages --pages cnn.com --timeout 60 ~44s).
