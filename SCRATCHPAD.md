BBC inline CSS perf: inline media removal -> ~11s layout/~23s total; replacing inline display:grid with block -> ~0.5s layout/~9s total. Inline styles drive slowdown. Grid profiling shows grid_ms ~31.5s over 1454 calls in original; display:block rewrite removes grid cost (~0.5s total layout). Inline CSS stats: 74 display:grid rules and 49 grid-template-columns rules in the main inline block (~70KB). A fast path that treats trivial grids as block landed, but BBC still ~24.6s total (layout ~13.2s), so grids don’t hit the trivial path; engine-level grid perf improvements still needed.
