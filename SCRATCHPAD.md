w3.org grid render fixed: grid layout now falls back to stacking children when Taffy reports zero-width grid items (FASTR_LOG_GRID_ROOT/FASTR_LOG_GRID_CHILDREN envs). Added w3.org to fetch_pages and regression `grid_children_are_laid_out_even_when_taffy_reports_zero_width`.

Render pipeline now decodes cached HTML with proper charset sniffing: fetch_pages stores the response Content-Type alongside each cached HTML (.html.meta), render_pages decodes bytes via the shared html::encoding helper (BOM/header/meta/default Windows-1252), and fetch_and_render reuses the shared decoder instead of its local copy. cloudflare.com timeout still outstanding; latimes.com now renders in ~27s at 1200×800 with current defaults.
Cloudflare render perf fixed: web font loading filters to the page’s codepoints (skipping unused @font-face ranges) and web font HTTP timeout is 10s; FASTR_RENDER_TIMINGS now reports css_parse/style_prepare/style_apply. cloudflare.com renders in ~12s at 1200×800 instead of 70s+.
Inline split guard: TextItem::split_at now bails out on non-char-boundary offsets (avoiding UTF-8 slice panics) with regressions for mid-emoji and `previous_char_boundary_in_text`; marker baseline/list-style-position/ellipsis regressions landed upstream. Split-at safety now returns None on non-character-boundary offsets (no silent clamping).
render_pages CLI now accepts --accept-language (default en-US,en;q=0.9); HttpFetcher uses the provided value alongside User-Agent when fetching linked assets, and usage/help logs the chosen header.
fetch_pages cache writes are now centralized: HTML caching writes optional .html.meta sidecars via a helper, and tests cover meta persistence/removal; charset sniffing coverage unaffected.
fetch_and_render now reads .meta sidecars for file:// HTML inputs (e.g., cached pages) and passes the cached Content-Type through decode_html_bytes; added a regression ensuring Shift-JIS HTML decodes via the meta charset.
Aligned fetcher user-agents: exported DEFAULT_USER_AGENT in resource.rs, fetch_and_render now sends it on HTTP requests, and fetch_pages uses the same Chrome-like UA instead of the old compatible string. Deduplicated DEFAULT_USER_AGENT after rebase.
Hyphenation breaks now filter out non-char-boundary offsets before use; itemized run splitting validates UTF-8 boundaries; shaping clusters clamp to UTF-8 boundaries with regression coverage.
HttpFetcher now follows redirects (up to 10) with the shared User-Agent; sends Accept-Language by default; retries misreported Content-Encoding by falling back to identity (`fetch_http_retries_on_bad_gzip`).
fetch_pages accepts --accept-language to override the header; treats empty HTTP bodies as errors (regression added) and reports failed URLs in the summary output.
latimes.com fetch/render previously timed out at 60s; rerendered successfully in ~27s (HTML cached under fetches/html/latimes.com.html). latimes.com UTF-8 boundary panic fixed via text split clamping (renders ≈72s at 1200×800 after fixes).
HTML parsing now disables scripting so <noscript> fallbacks are parsed/renderable; regressions ensure <noscript> content in <head> is preserved. fetch_and_render/render_pages/inspect_frag accept --prefers-reduced-data and --prefers-reduced-motion flags.
Bug hunt: github.com render appears dark but matches dark landing design (hero text/buttons visible near y≈200 in inspect_frag); likely no layout issue.
Vertical text-overflow coverage fixed for vertical writing; line fragments clamp to inline height.
Wikipedia portal: base_url/meta fixes + jsl10n-visible injection for html/body produce centered portal with assets loaded (PNG ~121KB). Unit test `fetch_bytes_uses_base_url_from_meta` added.
Fixed nowrap text-overflow + outside markers; added regressions for outside markers, start-side ellipsis, and image markers.
Unitless zero parsing fixed; calc/min/max/clamp parsing supports numeric properties (opacity/z-index/order) with regressions. Order property added to KNOWN_PROPERTIES; non-integer calc orders are ignored per spec.
Container queries respect inline-size without requiring a block dimension; optional logging via FASTR_LOG_CONTAINER_QUERY.
Added yahoo.com and nasa.gov to fetch_pages targets (cargo check --bin fetch_pages passes). Fetch/render notes: yahoo/nasa fetch succeed; yahoo now renders in ~14s (timings: cascade ~2.3s, layout ~5.9s) at 1200×800; nasa still times out at 60s (heavy page).
Added display-list renderer regressions for mix-blend-mode (non-isolated multiply vs isolated source-over).
render_pages/fetch_and_render support --timings to enable FASTR_RENDER_TIMINGS per-page logging; fetch_pages supports --timings for per-page fetch durations (including cache hits/errors).
booking.com fetch returns empty body even with Chrome UA; fetch_pages now treats empty bodies as errors and avoids caching them.
fetch_pages run populated cache for 85+ pages; render_pages rerun succeeded for all cached pages (86/86 pass) after split_at UTF-8 guard; latimes now renders (~106KB PNG).
Rowspan height distribution adjusted to favor auto rows while sharing spans; vertical text-overflow ellipsis tests now passing. Rowspan regressions (`calculate_row_heights_*`, `baseline_height_computation_skips_rowspanning_cells`) fixed.

HTTP fetcher: follows redirects (shared UA), sends Accept-Language default en-US,en;q=0.9 (exported DEFAULT_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE), retries bad Content-Encoding by falling back to identity (`fetch_http_retries_on_bad_gzip`). fetch_pages supports --accept-language, treats empty bodies as errors (regression added), reports failed URLs in the summary, and supports --timings for per-page durations. render_pages/fetch_and_render/inspect_frag accept --prefers-reduced-data/--prefers-reduced-motion; render_pages/fetch_and_render accept --timings; all three now also accept --prefers-contrast and --prefers-color-scheme, setting the corresponding FASTR_* env overrides.

Caching: fetch_pages centralized .html.meta writes; fetch_and_render reads sidecars for file:// caches and seeds base_url (`fetch_bytes_uses_base_url_from_meta` regression). fetch_pages rejects zero-byte bodies and logs failed URLs.

Text/layout fixes: hyphenation drops non-char-boundary offsets; run splitting validates UTF-8; shaping clusters clamp to char boundaries. No-wrap text-overflow with outside markers fixed (start-side ellipsis/image marker regressions). Unitless zero parsing fixed; calc/min/max/clamp now feed numeric properties (opacity/z-index/order) with regressions; match-parent text-align propagates to text-align-last. Container queries respect inline-size without block dimension (FASTR_LOG_CONTAINER_QUERY). Rowspan height distribution adjusted toward auto rows; vertical text-overflow ellipsis tests passing. Order property added to KNOWN_PROPERTIES; non-integer calc orders ignored per spec.

Page-specific: latimes.com UTF-8 split panic fixed; renders succeed (~53–72s @1200×800). wikipedia.org portal fixed (no-js→js-enabled, jsl10n-visible on html/body, meta base_url); PNG ~121KB. openbsd.org blank render fixed by laying out positioned children gathered via layout_block_child (regression `absolute_children_inside_block_descendants_are_laid_out`). yahoo.com and nasa.gov added to fetch_pages; yahoo now fetches/renders (~14s, ~29KB PNG); nasa remains heavy. booking.com returns empty body; fetch_pages treats empty bodies as errors.

Mix-blend-mode: regressions ensure non-isolated multiply darkens backdrop and isolated uses source-over.
CNN render with split_at guard now completes: render_pages --pages cnn.com --timeout 60 ~44s (cascade ~7s, box_tree ~4.6s, layout ~42s, paint ~0.5s).
