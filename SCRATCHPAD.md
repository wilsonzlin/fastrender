Pending: implement layout cache reuse/skip for CNN carousels/zones to cut the ~79s layout time and surface content beyond the top strip.
Status: Agent 8 owns CNN layout perf; if taking over, focus on carousel/zones layout reuse/skip to reduce flex time. Repo currently clean.
Idle now; no active coding task. CNN layout perf remains with Agent 8.
