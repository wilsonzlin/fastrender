Render pipeline now decodes cached HTML with proper charset sniffing: fetch_pages stores the response Content-Type alongside each cached HTML (.html.meta), render_pages decodes bytes via the shared html::encoding helper (BOM/header/meta/default Windows-1252), and fetch_and_render reuses the shared decoder instead of its local copy. cloudflare.com and latimes.com timeouts still outstanding from earlier notes.
