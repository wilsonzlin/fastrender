# Render debugging has moved

This content now lives in the canonical debug flags guide: [docs/debugging.md](../debugging.md).

That page lists all render/paint debugging environment flags (display-list dumps, oversized background logging aliases FASTR_LOG_LARGE_BACKGROUND(S), pixmap stats, etc.) with usage examples and tips for diagnosing blank/black renders.
