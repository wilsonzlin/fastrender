# Implement WPT Test Runner

## Context

Web Platform Tests (WPT) are the standard conformance tests for web engines. Implement runner to execute WPT tests against FastRender.

## Implementation

```rust
pub struct WptRunner {
    renderer: FastRender,
}

impl WptRunner {
    pub fn run_test(&mut self, test_path: &Path) -> TestResult;
    pub fn run_suite(&mut self, suite_dir: &Path) -> Vec<TestResult>;
}
```

Time: 10-14 hours
