# Notes

Small, durable writeups that explain “why/how” decisions that are worth keeping alongside the code.

- [logical-background-mapping.md](logical-background-mapping.md) — logical `background-position`/`background-size` mapping.
- [3d-transforms.md](3d-transforms.md) — 3D transform/perspective flattening and backface handling.
- [form-controls.md](form-controls.md) — replaced form controls, intrinsic sizing, and UA painting.
