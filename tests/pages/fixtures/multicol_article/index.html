      <h2>Columns keep flowing</h2>
      <p class="lede">
        Multi-column layout lets the text wrap across balanced columns while respecting the drop cap and pull quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Designers rely on the print-friendly article view to stay intact when rendered off-screen. This page exercises column
        balancing, column-span headers, and the interaction with margins when pagination kicks in. Inline links, numbers, and
        headings appear in a single pass without JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Body copy spans long enough to force column breaks. The renderer previously clipped backgrounds when a column had a
        drop cap next to a floated image; this snapshot keeps the shape simple but keeps the marker in place.
      </p>
      <div class="pullquote">“Columns remain one of the quickest ways to stress the inline layout code path.”</div>
      <p>
        The text continues with a few lines in each column. Metrics, summary boxes, and stitched paragraphs ensure the
        allocator chooses sensible breakpoints. Padding and borders come from shared styles to mirror how components are
        composed downstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logical properties stay neutral: margin collapsing, balanced column heights, and the column rule all share the
        available space. Vertical rhythm is kept in rem units to keep the baseline grid crisp at higher DPIs.
