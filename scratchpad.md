# Scratchpad – rendering engine session notes

## Context
- Project: Rust HTML/CSS renderer (`fastrender`), sandboxed workspace-write; network restricted.
- Taffy is vendored in `vendor/taffy/` and must not be updated via Cargo.
- Goal: make the renderer spec-faithful (tables, text shaping, painting) and remove site-specific hacks.

## Recent changes (this branch)
- Canvas now maintains clip masks (including rounded radii) and applies them to all primitives/text; display list renderer uses the clip radii, keeps transforms scoped with save/restore, avoids shrinking images to the clip rect, and has a regression for transform stacking plus clip-mask coverage in Canvas tests.
- `<img>` alt text now flows through the pipeline: ReplacedType::Image carries alt, intrinsic sizing falls back to shaped alt text when image loading fails/`src` is empty, and painter renders alt text instead of the gray placeholder. Tests cover both sizing and paint fallback.
- Display list builder now shapes text with the shared font context (using existing shaped runs when present) and emits alt text when images fail instead of gray placeholders, so display-list output matches painter fallback semantics.
- Display list text items now preserve font identity per shaped run (family/weight/style) and emit one item per run with correct bidi-aware glyph offsets; glyphs inherit the run’s direction/advance instead of flattening to a single anonymous font.
- Display list renderer grows feature coverage: respects linear/radial gradients via tiny-skia shaders, uses the canvas’ current blend mode for image/gradient draws, and clips gradients through the mask-aware Canvas path; regression tests cover transforms scoping and basic gradient rendering.
- Display list renderer now draws box shadows via the rasterizer (honoring opacity/blend/clip) and scopes stacking contexts through save/restore so nested clips don’t leak; added regressions for shadows and clip restoration.
- CSS gradients (linear/radial) now parse through the CSS value parser and paint as background images in the main painter, including stop normalization and clip-radius masking; gradient parsing/paint regressions added.
- Repeating gradients parsed and painted: repeating-linear/radial-gradient now map to background images, using repeat spread in the painter; parsing and paint regressions added.
- Display list gradients carry spread modes (pad/repeat/reflect) and the renderer maps them to tiny-skia; tests updated to set spreads and cover repeating linear gradients. Background cover offset test now matches the spec default `background-position: 0% 0%`.
- Background-repeat now supports the full grammar (repeat/space/round/no-repeat pairs): parsing builds per-axis keywords, painter rounds tile sizes for `round`, spaces tiles for `space` (first/last touch edges, background-position only when a single tile fits), and repeats patterns into the paint area. Added tiling helpers/tests for space and round.
- Added parsing coverage for background-repeat keywords/pairs to ensure style application maps shorthands and pair syntax correctly.
- `list-style-image` is parsed/inherited, resets via shorthand, and markers now carry either text or image content. Marker boxes load intrinsic sizes through the image cache, and inline layout positions image markers with outside/inside semantics (outside markers paint with negative offsets, inside markers consume a 0.5em gap). Box/debug printers and tests updated accordingly.
- Inline replaced elements now honor padding/borders in their inline box dimensions: layout accounts for padding/border in advance/width, marker images inherit the larger box, and inline fragment positions respect margins; added regression to guard inline replaced sizing.
- Bidi reordering now runs at paragraph scope: line builder aggregates paragraph text, feeds paragraph-level BidiInfo into each line, and preserves explicit embeddings across soft wraps. Added regression for unclosed RTL embeddings spanning lines.
- Table colspans now water-fill minimum widths: spanning cells first consume per-column headroom up to max widths, then grow all spanned columns evenly if needed; max widths expand evenly when spans exceed current sums. This keeps colspan constraints from unfairly flattening flexible columns.
- Colspan max expansion now favors columns with available headroom before falling back to even splits, so spanning cells don’t inflate already-tight columns unnecessarily; regression added for headroom-aware max distribution.
- Background-attachment parsed and respected: scroll/fixed/local stored in computed styles, and painter positions backgrounds relative to the viewport for `fixed` while clipping to the element. Gradients now use the positioning area separately from the paint area. Added regression covering fixed anchoring.
- `background-attachment: local` now anchors images to the scrollable overflow area (padding box) and treats `background-clip: border-box` like padding-box for scroll containers; clipping radii follow the adjusted box. Regression ensures border areas stay clear while padding paints.
- Background-size matches the CSS grammar: per-axis components accept length/percent/auto, single values default the second to auto, and cover/contain remain keywords. Painter resolves mixed auto/length pairs using intrinsic size/ratio (falling back to 100% when none) and rounding now checks explicit auto-auto. Parsing and paint regressions added.
- Background-position supports offset keywords per Images 3 syntax: components store alignment + offset, parse four-value forms like `right 10px top 25%` (with end offsets negated), default the missing axis to center, and painter resolves offsets against the available positioning area minus image size. Regression added for offsets/defaults.
- Background shorthand now resets all background fields to their initial values when set (including `none` and gradient/color shorthands) so stale repeat/position/size/attachment/origin/clip state doesn’t leak across declarations; regression covers reset.
- Background shorthand regression updated to expect authored repeat keywords (e.g. `no-repeat`) rather than default repeat after reset.
- Background shorthand now handles single-value forms (e.g. `background: red` or `background: none`) while still resetting all other background fields to their initial values.
- Background initial position now matches the spec default (0% 0% instead of center).
- Text decoration now matches CSS Text Decoration: line/style/color longhands are parsed, the shorthand resets unspecified parts, currentColor is honored, and painter draws solid/double/dotted/dashed/wavy lines with per-line positions.
- Text-decoration thickness is supported: longhand and shorthand accept lengths/keywords, defaulting to auto/from-font when unspecified; painter resolves authored thickness (including font/viewport-relative units) for underline/overline/line-through.
- list-style properties parsed and reset via shorthand (type/position), defaulting to `disc outside`.
- CSS counters parsed (`counter-reset`, `counter-increment`, `counter-set`), default list counters are scoped with CounterManager (default reset on `ol/ul`, default increment on `list-item` unless overridden), list markers format from counter values, and `lower-greek` is supported.
- List markers are dedicated marker boxes: markers no longer consume inline width when `list-style-position: outside`, paint from a negative offset to sit left of the content, and a regression checks marker/text positioning.
- Marker offsets use resolved marker margins (defaulting to 0.5em) and respect direction for outside positioning (RTL pushes markers right of the text start).
- Marker text ignores `text-transform` (styled from list-style type only) and skips hyphenation/breaking logic to stay atomic.
- ::marker pseudo support wired into cascade/box generation: selector parsing handles `::marker`, marker styles inherit list-style values with box-model resets, counter properties run during styled box generation, and marker boxes use pseudo `content` when provided. List-style now inherits, and styled pipeline uses counters for numbering. Added tests for list-style inheritance and marker styling.
- ::marker property restrictions tightened: marker styles are forced inline, box-model/layout effects are reset, and inline styles still inherit text properties; regression ensures authored display/padding/margins/background on ::marker are neutralized.
- ::marker text-transform forced to none in cascade to keep marker glyphs unaltered even if authors set transforms on the pseudo or list item; regression covers transform neutrality.
- Stacking-context display list path no longer double-emits descendants: stacking-context roots paint shallowly, child layers inherit the context origin for offsets, and stacking-tree construction keeps only direct children in layers while hoisting nested stacking contexts.
- Replaced content paints inside the content box: canvas images/SVGs now respect padding/border space during painting, dynamic images convert to premultiplied RGBA instead of BGRA to avoid channel swapping, and a regression covers padding isolation for replaced elements.
- Overflow clipping now applies in paint: stacking contexts generated for overflow hidden/scroll/auto clip descendants to the padding box with radius-aware masks and a hard pixel clip (prevents filter bleed); backgrounds/borders are left unclipped, and partial-axis overflow (x hidden / y visible) keeps visible axis unmasked. Regression updated accordingly.
 - Added per-axis overflow clipping regression for `overflow-y: hidden` with horizontal overflow visible; painter respects axis-specific clipping.
- Stacking-context bounds now include transforms and filter/backdrop outsets, and layer offsets come from the visual bounds so translated/rotated children aren't clipped by ancestor offscreen buffers. Added regression to ensure transformed children remain visible through parent stacking contexts.
- Overflow clips now shrink stacking-context layer bounds before filters/backdrop filters are applied: descendant bounds are intersected with the authored clip axes while keeping the root background/border uncut, preventing massive offscreen buffers and backdrop sampling beyond the padding box. Regression added to guard clipped bounds.
- Table row heights now honor row `height` (px/em/%): row-specified lengths become minimums, percentage rows resolve against a definite table height, and tables with `height`/`min-height` stretch rows to meet that target. New tests cover specified table height and percentage row heights with a definite table height.
- Table `max-height` now clamps the table’s used height (rows may overflow), ensuring bounding boxes respect author caps; regression added.
- Percentage row heights now resolve against the table height minus border-spacing gaps in separate border model, so row percent shares exclude spacing and spacing consumes its own slice of the table height. Added regression for percentage rows with vertical spacing.
- Row `min-height`/`max-height` are honored (px/em/%): author constraints are applied per row with percent bases tied to the table’s definite height (minus spacing), and row heights are clamped accordingly.
- Row percentage heights now resolve only when the table height is definite (specified height or containing block height); table `min-height` alone no longer triggers percentage resolution. Added regression for percent rows with only min-height.
- Percent rows now clamp to their target percent share when a definite table height exists (after subtracting spacing), so percentage rows are guaranteed their authored share instead of relying on later distribution. Regression still covers spacing/min-height behaviors.
- Specified table height now drives the used table height (clamped by min/max) rather than collapsing to content when provided.
- Percent rows fill the remaining height when mixed with auto rows: any leftover space after percent targets is distributed to non-percent rows (falling back to percent rows if needed), ensuring the sum of row heights matches the table height.
- Row distribution no longer shrinks rows below their laid-out content: percent/auto scaling is clamped to content-driven minimums so over-100% percentage mixes don’t overlap cells. Added regression `percent_rows_overflow_do_not_shrink_content`.
- Percent rows that total more than 100% are no longer scaled down to the table height; they keep their targets (respecting content minima) even if that overflows the specified height. Regression `percent_rows_over_100_percent_do_not_scale_down` covers the over-100% case with empty rows.
- Table boxes now honor padding and borders in separate border model: children are offset by padding+border, total bounds include those edges, and percentage row bases remain the content box. Collapsed tables still ignore padding per CSS 2.1. Regressions cover padding offsets and border expansion of bounds.
- Percentage row bases now exclude padding/borders and spacing (content box) when the table height is definite, keeping author percentages tied to the usable content height while the specified height remains a border-box.
- Column widths now subtract padding/borders from the available content width in the separated border model, intrinsic widths add padding/border edges, and when a definite table width is present (auto layout) flexible columns expand to fill the remaining content width after spacing/edges. Column distributor behavior for standalone use stays capped at max widths.
- Display list builder now decodes replaced images using `ImageCache` (including inline SVG), falling back to a placeholder only when decoding fails. Added regression for inline SVG decoding in the display list path.
- Display list builder now applies `object-fit/object-position` to image/SVG display items, using the same sizing semantics as paint. SVG sources (`ReplacedType::Svg`) are rasterized through the image cache too, so inline SVGs reach the display list with correct fitting. Added regression for contain centering.
- Object-position percentages in the display list builder now resolve as stored fractions (no double `/100`) and length-based components honor percentage resolution helpers; keyword handling uses the shared `PositionKeyword`.
- Object-fit/object-position math is centralized in `paint::object_fit` and alignment space is no longer clamped to zero, so oversized images can align with negative offsets; both painter and display list share the helper and tests cover overflow alignment/percent positioning.
- Default object-position now lives in the shared helper and display list falls back to CSS initial values when a fragment lacks style, keeping painter/display list defaults aligned.
- Object-position length components now resolve font-relative units using the element font-size (via shared helper), and helpers accept viewport size when available; painter supplies viewport/pixmap size while display-list builder degrades gracefully without one.
- Display list builder can now take a viewport size so `vw`/`vh` in object-position resolve per CSS Values; added regression to confirm viewport-relative alignment through the display list path and shared helper coverage for viewport units.
- Anonymous fixup now splits inline boxes that contain block-level descendants so the blocks participate in the parent's block flow; inline fragments keep their styles, replaced elements with inline display stay inline-level in the fixup checks, and regressions cover inline/block descendants and inline-block immunity.
- `text-indent` now matches CSS Text semantics: hanging no longer indents the first line (even with `each-line`), subsequent lines shift by the indent, intrinsic inline-size accounting matches the layout behavior, and regressions cover hanging/each-line combinations and hanging intrinsic widths.
- Negative `text-indent` no longer expands the available line width; line breaking now attempts to split breakable items even on empty lines (choosing the earliest break when none fit), preventing over-wide first items from swallowing following words. Regression added.
- Replaced SVGs now rasterize via resvg for both inline content and URL/data sources: painter draws SVGs with `object-fit/object-position`, and intrinsic sizes/aspect ratios are populated from rendered SVGs. Inline SVG rendering and intrinsic resolution are covered by new tests.
- Image loader now decodes SVG files/HTTP responses by MIME/extension/sniffing `<svg` text so external SVGs no longer fail rasterization; `ImageCache::render_svg_to_image` is public for reuse, and loaders/tests cover inline SVG rendering and intrinsic resolution via `FastRender`.
- `text-align-last` now applies per paragraph (forced breaks/newlines): the last line before a hard break uses `text-align-last`, not only the final line of the block. Regression added.
- `text-align-last: justify` now falls back to start when a line/paragraph has no justification opportunities (no spaces/clusters to expand), preventing over-justifying single-word lines while keeping paragraph-aware last-line handling.
- `text-align: justify-all` is parsed to justify all lines (including the last via `text-align-last: justify`), justification opportunity checks now probe split text items (so single text nodes with spaces still justify), and inter-word justification falls back to explicit space boundaries when the break finder misses them.
- `text-align: match-parent` is supported: parsing produces a match-parent value that resolves at cascade time to left/right based on the parent’s direction, and inline layout tests cover RTL inheritance.
- `text-align-all` shorthand supported: parsed values map to text-align, reset `text-align-last` to auto for non-justify-all/match-parent cases, and justify-all sets last-line justification.
- `match-parent` resolution now follows CSS Text: resolves to start/end based on parent direction (not left/right).
- `text-align` shorthand now resets `text-align-last` to auto (except justify-all → justify), with cascade tests validating reset/justify-all behavior.
- `match-parent` now inherits parent alignment fully (including non-start/end values) and maps start/end to physical alignment using the parent’s direction; cascade tests cover both inheritance and directional mapping.
- Image cache now keys entries by resolved URLs, preventing duplicate fetches when base URL resolution changes the concrete request.
- Collapsed-border conflict resolution now has added regression coverage for style precedence (double vs lower styles) and top-edge bias; CJK auto-justify test explicitly sets `text-align-last: justify` so forced breaks still justify under paragraph-aware last-line handling.
- Added regression to ensure justify-last fallback for space-less lines; paragraph-aware alignment remains intact.
- Collapsing border conflict resolution now follows CSS 2.1 ordering (hidden suppression, width before style ranking, cell/row/col/table precedence, and left/top bias honoring `direction`), with new coverage for width-vs-style and LTR/RTL tie cases.
- `tab-size` is parsed/inherited (number or length, default 8); preserved tabs (`white-space: pre/pre-wrap`) become explicit tab items that advance to the next stop based on the space advance or length, participate in bidi/script analysis, and have regression coverage for parsing/preservation/stop alignment.
- CRLF pairs are normalized to single segment breaks across whitespace modes: pre/pre-wrap emit one mandatory break per CRLF, pre-line keeps one hard break with collapsed whitespace, and normal/nowrap treat CRLF as a single collapsible space. Tests cover the CRLF handling for pre/pre-line.
- Segment breaks now cover VT/FF too: pre/pre-wrap emit mandatory breaks for form-feed/vertical tab, pre-line and normal/nowrap treat them as collapsible whitespace. Added regressions for FF in pre and VT collapsing in normal.
- `normalize_text_for_white_space` now returns a struct with normalized text, forced breaks, soft-wrap eligibility, and leading/trailing collapsible flags (CR/LF/VT/FF-aware). IFC callers/tests updated; edge flags are ready for cross-node whitespace collapsing.
- Collapsible whitespace between adjacent inline/text boxes now survives DOM splits: trailing collapsible runs are carried as pending spaces, realized before the next inline item (including inline boxes/replaced/inline-block), and dropped at line end. Tests cover text-to-text, text-to-inline box, and trailing suppression.
- Added `white-space: break-spaces`: parsed and normalized to preserve all spaces/tabs, emit mandatory breaks for CR/LF/VT/FF, allow wrapping, and avoid collapsible flags so sequences persist. Parsing test + normalization regression added.
- Refined `word-break: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word`: removed eager per-character breaks from default opportunities, keep min-content sizing unchanged, and add emergency character-boundary fallback only when a token overflows and wrapping is allowed. Tests cover overflow splitting, nowrap suppression, and min-content parity for both properties.
- Column span constraints distribute minimums using existing headroom (max-min) before evenly inflating all spanned columns; max constraints inflate evenly. New tests cover headroom-preferred splits and no-headroom fallback (`src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Rowspan height distribution now uses weighted expansion (preferring existing row heights/baseline requirements) instead of equal splits, and baseline-aligned spanning cells reserve their baseline offset in the first row so baseline positioning has room (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Auto table distribution now preserves min-content when over-constrained: available < total min keeps min widths and flags overflow. Percentage columns shrink (but not below their min) when fixed+percent would starve flexible columns, leaving room for flexible mins; percent columns still honor their mins if that means over-constraint. Added targeted tests for both behaviors (`src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Percentage-only tables over 100% now scale percents proportionally (respecting min/max) when no flexible columns exist; if mins alone over-constrain, we keep them and expose overflow. Added tests for over-100% percent tables with/without min over-constraint (`src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Over-constraint integration tests now expect min widths to be preserved (no proportional scaling) with explicit overflow reporting; fixed-width overflow test updated accordingly (`tests/table_columns_test.rs`).
- Inline bidi reordering now uses byte indices (not char counts) when selecting run directions, walks all paragraphs in the line, and has a regression for multi-byte RTL followed by LTR text to prevent incorrect run reversal (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline bidi reordering now slices mixed-direction text items into per-run fragments before visual ordering, so RTL/LTR content within a single text node reorders correctly; added regression for a single mixed-direction text run and preserved synthetic test widths without reshaping (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline boxes are flattened into bidi leaves so descendants reorder with siblings; inline box edges (padding/border) are reapplied to the first/last visual fragment of each box after reordering to keep backgrounds/borders aligned with visual start/end (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- `unicode-bidi: plaintext` now forces first-strong paragraph direction regardless of the builder base level (effective base set to None when any plaintext leaf is present); regression added (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Bidi isolation now respects ancestor `unicode-bidi` settings: inline box stacks emit the appropriate embedding/isolation controls (embed/override/isolate/isolate-override) based on their direction, so isolated spans no longer disturb surrounding runs. Added isolate regression (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Plaintext on ancestors now triggers first-strong paragraph direction (box stack considered, not just leaves), and isolation regression added for `unicode-bidi:isolate` inline boxes (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Plaintext leaves/ancestors now drop inserted isolation controls and derive the paragraph base level via first-strong analysis of the concatenated logical text before running bidi (so plaintext isn’t skewed by LRI/RLI wrappers); added RTL-first plaintext regression (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Bidi logical-text construction now balances embedding/isolation controls across shared ancestor stacks instead of emitting opens/closes per leaf; contexts are opened/closed only when the stack changes, preventing unbalanced sequences. Added regression for multi-leaf isolate inline boxes (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline bidi context management now keeps ancestor isolates/embeddings open across leaves (opens/ closes only on stack transitions) so multi-leaf isolates share one context and neutrals resolve across sibling leaves; added regression covering multi-leaf isolate neutral resolution (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Added rowspan vertical-align regression to ensure spanning cells don't collapse subsequent rows and heights remain positive (`src/layout/table.rs` test).
- Baseline-aligned rowspans now explicitly reserve baseline space in the first row; added regression to guard the baseline reservation for spanning cells (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Collapsed border model now covered by a bounds regression: table fragments include collapsed stroke widths even with empty cells (`src/layout/table.rs` test).
- Collapsed border row offsets covered by regression: total height accounts for collapsed top/bottom strokes plus minimal row height (`src/layout/table.rs` test).
- Collapsed border positioning regression ensures cell fragments are offset by collapsed border widths and overall table width reflects stroke thickness (`src/layout/table.rs` test).
- Percent columns are treated as auto when the table inline size is indefinite (auto/max-content/min-content without a definite containing block); regression added (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Collapsed border + rowspan vertical-align regression asserts placement under collapsed borders (`src/layout/table.rs` test).
- Auto layout now keeps percentage columns at their authored percentages (clamped to min/max) even if they over-constrain the table; flexible columns take their mins and over-constraint is reported instead of shrinking percents. Updated tests to reflect CSS2.1 behavior (`src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Removed HN-specific hacks (vote arrow injection, navigation text forcing) from `src/tree/box_generation.rs`.
- Default font size restored to 16px (`src/style/mod.rs`); table margins stripped back to zero in defaults.
- Fixed BGRA → RGBA conversion during image encoding (`src/image_output.rs`).
- Inline text fragments now carry computed styles; painter uses shaping pipeline and real glyph outlines instead of box approximations (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Table layout rewritten to use computed display values, default border-spacing 2px 2px, column constraints via `column_distribution`, `<col>/<colgroup>` width handling, min/max from IFC, fallback equal widths if zero; cells laid out with BFC using computed column widths (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Added `FragmentNode::new_inline_styled` convenience (`src/tree/fragment_tree.rs`).
- Inline FC now shapes with `ShapingPipeline`, keeps shaped runs on fragments, and uses real font metrics for struts/baselines; painter reuses those runs with pen advance and rudimentary RTL handling (`src/layout/contexts/inline`, `src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Added embedded Roboto Regular fallback for fontless environments and generic fallbacks now pick the first available face when generic lookup fails (`resources/fonts`, `src/text/font_loader.rs`, `src/text/font_db.rs`).
- Block FC now buffers inline-level children (including inline replaced/inline-block) and lays them out with `InlineFormattingContext`; inline-blocks get laid out through their own formatting context as atomic inline items (`src/layout/contexts/block/mod.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Tests currently pass (`cargo test`).
- Replaced elements now resolve intrinsic sizes from actual images via `ImageCache` (using base URL from API/bin), reuse those sizes in inline/block layout, and the painter renders decoded images instead of gray placeholders (`src/api.rs`, `src/layout/utils.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/{block,inline}`, `src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Inline text breaking now aligns break opportunities and splits to cluster boundaries using shaped glyphs; `TextItem` tracks cumulative cluster advances so wrapping and mandatory breaks no longer slice through ligatures/combining marks (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline line finalization now performs bidi visual reordering per line with the Unicode algorithm, treating non-text inline items as object replacements; x-positions are reassigned in visual order so mixed-direction lines place RTL runs correctly (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- CSS `direction` is now parsed/inherited (initial `ltr`), carried through computed styles, and used as the base paragraph direction for bidi analysis and per-line reordering (`src/style/{types,mod,properties,cascade}.rs`, `src/text/pipeline.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Added CSS `unicode-bidi` support (normal/embed/override/isolate/isolate-override/plaintext), plumbed through computed styles and applied during inline line reordering via appropriate UBA control characters; per-item direction comes from computed style and non-text items still participate via object replacement markers (`src/style/{types,mod,properties,cascade}.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline splits now preserve shaped glyphs instead of reshaping: splitting uses existing runs at cluster boundaries, adjusts glyph offsets/advances without re-running HarfBuzz, so ligatures/kerning survive across line breaks (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Non-text inline/replaced items now enter bidi reordering wrapped in directionally isolated control characters (LRI/RLI…PDI) rather than bare U+FFFC, improving structural ordering for mixed-direction lines (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline boxes now contribute their children’s text into the bidi reorder string instead of collapsing to a single object, so nested inline wrappers reorder according to their actual textual content (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Centralized bidi control generation with `bidi_controls`; logical-text construction now wraps inline boxes and atomic inline items per `unicode-bidi` values without auto-isolating inline-block/replaced placeholders when `unicode-bidi` is `normal` (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Inline-block sizing now uses CSS 2.1 shrink-to-fit when `width:auto`, deriving preferred and preferred-min widths from intrinsic measurements and adding padding/borders; specified widths avoid over-constrained margins, and padding/border percentages resolve against the available inline size (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Block layout now clamps computed content widths to `min-width`/`max-width` (percentages resolved against containing block) and recomputes margins with the clamped width so the constraint equation still holds when author limits kick in (`src/layout/contexts/block/mod.rs`).
- Inline replaced elements now honor horizontal margins: margins are resolved in the inline context, included in line advance, and their fragments are offset so margins behave as spacing rather than painted area (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Intrinsic sizing for inline content now excludes margins (replaced elements contribute their border-box width to min/max-content sums while layout still accounts for margins separately) to better match CSS sizing definitions (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Inline-blocks now resolve horizontal margins, subtract them from available inline space for shrink-to-fit sizing, and include them in line advance while only the border-box is painted (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Block intrinsic inline-size computation now accounts for inline content, in-flow block children, replaced boxes, and the element’s own padding/borders instead of just explicit widths (`src/layout/contexts/block/mod.rs`).
- Table column intrinsic widths now use the cell’s formatting context (block/flex/grid/inline) instead of forcing inline measurement, so block-only cells contribute widths correctly (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- `border-spacing` is now parsed/resolved from computed style (em/absolute lengths) and table layout pulls spacing from styles rather than a hardcoded 2px default (`src/style/{mod,properties}.rs`, `src/layout/table.rs`).
- Table column constraints now honor percentage widths on cells/cols and carry them through distribution, so percentage-specified columns consume their share of the available table width before auto distribution (`src/layout/table.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Percentage columns remain unscaled even when total percentages exceed 100%, matching current column distribution expectations; over-constraint is flagged and flexible columns collapse to their minima (`src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Colspan contributions now use the spanning-cell constraint distributor so multi-column cells raise min/max widths across the spanned range rather than per-column equal splits (`src/layout/table.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/table/column_distribution.rs`).
- Parsed `border-collapse` into computed styles and table spacing respects collapsed mode by zeroing spacing when collapse is set (`src/style/{types,mod,properties}.rs`, `src/layout/table.rs`).
- CSS `vertical-align` is now parsed/stored (UA default `middle` for `td/th`), and table layout uses baseline-aware row heights plus per-cell alignment for baseline/top/middle/bottom cases (`src/style/{types,mod,properties.rs,user_agent.css}`, `src/layout/table.rs`).
- CSS `table-layout` is parsed and stored; fixed layout now selects the fixed distribution path in the column distributor (`src/style/{types,mod,properties.rs}`, `src/layout/table.rs`).
- Fixed table layout now only inspects the first row for column sizing and ignores later rows when collecting constraints, matching CSS 2.1 fixed layout behavior (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Explicit table widths (px/%, em/rem) are resolved against the containing block and used as the available table width; column distribution now honors author-specified table widths (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Table widths respect `min-width`/`max-width` when clamping explicit/containing widths, and intrinsic width calculation for collapsed borders excludes border widths (padding only) so columns aren’t inflated by collapsed borders (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Border styles now cover hidden/groove/ridge/inset/outset; collapsed-border conflict resolution honors style priority (hidden > double > solid > dashed > dotted > ridge > outset > groove > inset > none), width, and origin order, with new tests for hidden suppression and style vs. width precedence (`src/style/types.rs`, `src/style/properties.rs`, `src/layout/table.rs`).
- Collapsed borders now participate in layout: cell borders are zeroed for layout, collapsed border grid lines carry resolved widths/styles/colors and total table width/height includes them; line-level border fragments are emitted for painting when collapsed, and table border widths are zeroed at paint time to avoid double drawing (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Layout now shares a single `FontContext` across the pipeline: `LayoutEngine`/`FormattingContextFactory` are built with the caller’s font context, block/inline/table contexts propagate it to child FCs, and `FastRender` constructs layout using the same context it hands to paint. Inline-block/table measurement now uses caller-provided fonts consistently (`src/layout/{engine,contexts/factory,contexts/block,contexts/inline}, src/layout/table.rs`, `src/api.rs`).
- CSS `white-space` behaviors are respected in inline layout: text is normalized per mode (collapse for normal/nowrap/pre-line, preservation for pre/pre-wrap), explicit breaks are inserted for newlines, wrapping is suppressed for `nowrap`/`pre`, and break opportunities are filtered accordingly. New unit coverage for normal/nowrap/pre flows (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- CSS text breaking properties added: `word-break` and `overflow-wrap` parsed into computed styles, and inline layout augments/removes break opportunities accordingly (`break-all`/`anywhere` add cluster breaks, `keep-all` prunes non-whitespace breaks) so min/max-content sizing and line breaking respond to author settings (`src/style/{types,mod,properties}.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Hyphenation support added: `hyphens` parsed into computed styles, soft hyphens are removed while preserving their break points, and `hyphens:auto` uses a default English hyphenator to inject additional break opportunities so wrapped words can hyphenate per author intent (`src/style/{types,mod,properties}.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Language inheritance from `lang`/`xml:lang` is normalized to lower-case BCP47 strings and passed through to shaping; HarfBuzz buffers now receive the computed language and shaped runs record it for debugging (`src/style/{mod,cascade}.rs`, `src/text/pipeline.rs`).
- Letter- and word-spacing now affect shaped runs and line metrics: spacing is applied after each cluster (word spacing layered on spaces), advances and glyph offsets updated, and unit tests cover the extra advance contributions (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Hyphenation breaks now insert a hyphen glyph at the break point (soft/auto hyphenation), preserving spacing and shaping with the same style; break metadata carries an `adds_hyphen` flag so line breaking can decide when to render the glyph (`src/text/line_break.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Border painting now respects CSS styles: dotted/dashed use dash patterns (round caps for dotted), double splits into parallel strokes, and inset/outset/groove/ridge apply shaded light/dark variants per edge (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Text decorations are painted per spec defaults: underline/overline/line-through use font metrics for position/thickness with color from current text (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- CSS `text-transform` now applies before shaping/whitespace handling, covering uppercase, lowercase, and capitalize in inline layout (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs` tests added).
- Inline line fragments honor `text-align` (left/center/right/justify/start/end); justification spreads remaining inline space across word gaps on non-final lines, splitting text items at internal spaces and CJK break points so gaps inside a single run expand too (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- `text-align` now supports start/end mapped through `direction`; default text-align is `start`. `text-align-last` is parsed/stored and applied: last lines map start/end/left/right/center/justify, `auto` follows CSS defaults (justified paragraphs use start on final line, single-line non-justify uses text-align) (`src/style/{types.rs,mod.rs,computed.rs,properties.rs}`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Justification honors `text-justify`: parsed values (auto/none/inter-word/inter-character/distribute) feed inline justification. None forces start alignment even on explicit justify, auto/inter-word keep word-gap/CJK expansion, and inter-character/distribute expand at every cluster boundary. Last-line justify now applies when authored via `text-align-last`. TextItem exposes cluster byte offsets for inter-character splitting (`src/style/{types,mod,properties}.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/{line_builder.rs,mod.rs}`).
- `text-indent` is parsed/inherited (length/percentage with hanging/each-line keywords) and applied during inline layout: indentation adjusts first/subsequent line available widths and offsets item placement per writing direction, with coverage for first-line vs. each-line behavior. Line boxes keep full available width when known so indentation doesn't shrink the block, unknown widths include indent extents, and intrinsic inline sizes add positive indent so shrink-to-fit honors offsets (`src/style/{types,mod,properties,cascade}.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/{line_builder.rs,mod.rs}`).
- `text-justify:auto` now resolves heuristically: per-line script analysis picks inter-character when CJK dominates (otherwise inter-word). Fallback splits use per-character offsets when shaping lacks clusters, and CJK auto-justify coverage ensures per-cluster expansion (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs` tests).
- Ignoring synthetic mandatory breaks at end-of-text prevents empty justified lines; forced breaks still trigger splitting (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Min-content sizing for inline content now walks the inline stream with shaped cluster advances, respecting hyphen insertion widths and avoiding synthetic end-of-text breaks between adjacent text nodes; forced breaks from normalization are tracked so explicit newlines still split segments. Added unit coverage for hyphen width accounting and cross-node words (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Max-content sizing for inline content now measures shaped clusters and only breaks on mandatory breaks (e.g., preserved newlines), so maximum width reflects the longest forced line rather than naive summing; inline boxes include their edges, and atomic inline/replaced boxes contribute without introducing breaks. New test covers preserved-newline behavior (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Replaced images now honor CSS `object-fit` (fill/contain/cover/none/scale-down) and `object-position` (length/percent/keywords) during painting, centering and scaling content appropriately while keeping layout size unchanged. Added parsing and style defaults plus painter regression test (`src/style/{types,mod,properties.rs}`, `src/paint/painter.rs`).
- CSS parser now preserves space-separated value lists (e.g., `object-position: left 25%`) as `Multiple` so object-position parsing receives both components (`src/css/properties.rs`).
- Background positioning now obeys `background-position`, `background-origin`, and `background-clip` with proper percentage semantics (percentages resolve against the positioning area minus image size). Painter tiles images/clips to the selected box (border/padding/content) and centers/offsets from the chosen origin; defaults now match spec (origin padding-box, clip border-box) (`src/style/{types,mod,properties.rs}`, `src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Inline-level elements now materialize as `InlineBoxItem`s carrying padding/borders, vertical offsets, and styles so backgrounds/borders participate in painting; `vertical-align` from computed styles is resolved (length/percentage) and applied to text, inline boxes, inline-blocks, and replaced elements (`src/layout/contexts/inline/{mod.rs,line_builder.rs}`).
- Inline box baselines are derived from their children (falling back to strut when empty) instead of always using the parent strut; padding/border insets adjust ascent/descent so nested inline boxes contribute realistic baselines (`src/layout/contexts/inline/mod.rs`).
- Replaced element sizing now resolves percentage widths/heights/min/max when a containing block size is available; percentage lengths with no base fall back to intrinsic sizes to avoid bogus zeros (`src/layout/utils.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/{block,inline}/mod.rs`).
- Block and inline formatting contexts propagate definite containing-block heights; percentage heights/min-heights/max-heights resolve when a base exists and fall back to auto/0/∞ when not. Vertical padding/border resolution uses the containing width to avoid panics on percentages, inline-block percentage heights honor available block height, and percentage bases for replaced sizing ignore NaN placeholders. Added tests for block/inline-block percentage height resolution (`src/layout/utils.rs`, `src/layout/contexts/{block,inline}/mod.rs`).
- Inline-block baselines now come from the last in-flow line box inside the fragment when present, falling back to the bottom border edge only when no lines exist. Baseline metrics for inline-blocks now use ascent/descent derived from that line instead of treating them as replaced elements (`src/layout/contexts/inline/line_builder.rs`).
- Collapsed table borders are painted as individual border edges using the resolved style/color/width for each grid line instead of flat stripes; vertical/horizontal borders are centered on grid boundaries and drawn with border styles (dotted/dashed/double/inset/outset/etc.) via the painter (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Collapsed border data now carries per-segment winners (one border resolution per grid line segment), and painting renders each segment with its own style/color/width using boundary-aware positioning based on adjacent perpendicular segment widths so adjoining borders meet cleanly instead of flattening to a uniform line (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Collapsed border corners now resolve a winner per grid junction and paint a square join using that style/color/width, reducing double-paint overlaps at intersections (`src/layout/table.rs`).
- Display-list construction now walks stacking contexts using `paint::stacking::creates_stacking_context`, emitting commands in stacking order (negative/zero/positive contexts) rather than globally sorting by z-index; backgrounds/borders for each context stay ahead of its content and descendants (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Stacking contexts with `opacity < 1` now render into their own layer and composite back into the canvas so opacity applies to the entire subtree instead of per-primitive alpha (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Opacity layers are now bounded to the stacking context’s content: commands are translated to a minimal bounding rectangle and composited back with a translation, avoiding full-canvas temporary buffers for translucent contexts (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Stacking contexts now honor CSS `transform`: transforms are composed into the context’s layer, applied around the fragment’s top-left, and rendered via a translated offscreen buffer before compositing back. Basic translate/scale/rotate/skew/matrix forms are supported; percentages resolve against the context’s box (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- CSS `transform-origin` is parsed (length/percentage/keywords), stored in computed styles (default 50% 50%), and respected when composing stacking-context transforms so rotation/scale occur around the authored origin instead of top-left (`src/style/{mod.rs,properties.rs,types.rs}`, `src/paint/painter.rs`).
- CSS `mix-blend-mode` and `isolation` are parsed and stored; stacking contexts are created for non-normal blend modes or isolation, and painter composites layers using the mapped blend mode (`src/style/{types.rs,mod.rs,properties.rs}`, `src/paint/{stacking.rs,painter.rs}`).
- Isolation `isolate` now forces SourceOver when compositing the isolated layer back into its parent to prevent backdrop blending across contexts (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- CSS `filter` is parsed and stored (blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, sepia, saturate, hue-rotate, invert, opacity, drop-shadow). CurrentColor is deferred, lengths stay unresolved until paint, and `filter != none` creates a stacking context (`src/style/{types.rs,mod.rs,properties.rs}`, `src/paint/stacking.rs`).
- Painter resolves filters per stacking context, expands layer bounds for blur/drop-shadow outsets, and applies effects in order: color matrix filters, opacity, Gaussian blur, and drop-shadow with spread/blur/offset composited behind content (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Added filter parsing unit coverage for multi-function lists and drop-shadow defaults (`src/style/properties.rs` tests).
- CSS `backdrop-filter` is parsed (reusing the filter function set) and forces stacking contexts; painter copies the backdrop within the context bounds, applies the resolved filters (including blur/drop-shadow outsets), and composites it back before drawing the context, so backdrop blur/drop-shadow are visible behind translucent content (`src/style/{types.rs,mod.rs,properties.rs}`, `src/paint/{stacking.rs,painter.rs}`).
- Filters and backdrop-filters now clip to the element’s border box with resolved border radii: stacking layers and backdrop regions are masked by the computed rounded-rect radii before compositing, preventing glow/blur from bleeding outside rounded corners (`src/paint/painter.rs`).
- Background colors and images respect border-radius and `background-clip`: clip radii shrink with border/padding/content edges, fills draw as rounded rects, and image tiling is masked to the clipped rounded box (`src/paint/painter.rs`).

## Current issues / gaps
- Bidi: still relies on injected controls to drive UAX#9 (no dedicated embedding/isolate stack), though paragraph-level resolution and stack handling now opens/closes on context transitions.
- Justification lacks script-aware expansion (kashida/justification alternates, punctuation stretching) and `text-justify` is still approximated (auto treated as inter-word; no trim/edge handling).
- `text-align-last` currently maps start/end via direction; nuanced interaction with `text-justify` and additional values still pending.
- `text-indent` hanging/each-line semantics are approximate; indentation doesn’t yet handle hanging outdents per spec nuances.
- Max-content sizing now honors mandatory breaks but still ignores anonymous inline box generation and percent-driven height constraints.
- Table layout still partial: row/col spans not fully honored (rowspan baselines, percent/fixed widths still simplified vs CSS 2.1), colspan distribution still heuristic.
- Replaced elements still skip backgrounds and non-image types (SVG/iframe/video remain unrendered); object-fit only applies when image decoding succeeds.
- Painting lacks filters and isolation nuances (auto/isolate behavior), and still doesn't integrate the richer display list module; mix-blend-mode is supported but 3D transforms/transform-origin z and filter/mix-blend/isolation interplay are ignored.
- Root line strut still provides minimum line-height rather than full descendant baseline synthesis; replaced backgrounds/non-image types remain unpainted.

## To-do / next steps (spec-oriented)
1. Inline/text:
   - Build bidi-aware flattening of inline boxes so descendants reorder per UAX#9 while maintaining box edges/backgrounds; lift `unicode-bidi: plaintext` to paragraph-scoped handling.
   - Align baseline/line-height calculations with real font metrics across multi-font runs.
   - Harden RTL run positioning and visual reordering in painter/layout so mixed-direction text paints correctly.
2. Tables:
   - Finish CSS 2.1 auto table layout: full border-collapse model including per-segment conflict resolution, style-aware painting (dotted/dashed/double geometry), percent/fixed widths resolved per spec, correct colspan/rowspan distribution (including baseline handling for rowspans), and row height/baseline behavior under collapsed borders.
3. Replaced content:
   - Render images for `ReplacedType::Image` instead of placeholders.
4. General bidi:
   - Ensure visual ordering in layout and paint for RTL/mixed runs.
5. Inline blocks:
   - Generate proper anonymous inline wrappers; validate remaining percentage/min-height edge cases and baseline behavior in nested formatting contexts.
6. Lists/markers:
   - Implement ::marker property restrictions and inside positioning geometry; round out counter style coverage and marker inheritance edge cases.

## Notes
- Current table code uses `InlineFormattingContext` for cell intrinsic widths; this fails for block/table/replaced content—needs a per-context intrinsic measurement.
- Default font family remains `"serif"`; UA defaults can be revisited when baseline metrics are real.

## Remote branch (cursor/pixel-perfect-news-ycombinator-com-rendering-gpt-5.1-codex-high-b0ad) scan
- Block FC: buffers inline children and runs them through `InlineFormattingContext` as a group, with margin collapse handling. Better than placeholder inline fragments—worth adopting concept.
- Painter: introduces `FontContext` parameter to `paint_tree`/`Painter::new` and uses `TextShaper` + `TextRasterizer` (`shape_text_simple`) with guessed font size; still LTR-only and style-agnostic. We already have a more capable shaping pipeline; don’t regress, but sharing the font context between layout/paint is a good idea.
- Table: adds a simplistic cell-content layout by stacking child fragments or collected text; ignores padding/borders/inline flow—worse than current plan.
- Inline FC: minor guard for mandatory breaks past end-of-text.

Actionable borrowings:
- Integrate the block inline-buffering approach (layout inline groups via IFC, flush on block children).
- Consider passing a shared `FontContext` into paint_tree/painter so paint and layout use the same font state.
