 - PositionedLayout absolute helper now delegates to AbsoluteLayout for spec-accurate shrink-to-fit/auto-margin handling; positioned layout tests updated (shrink-to-fit expectation) and an auto-margin centering regression added. `cargo test --quiet test_absolute_position_left_right_shrink_to_fit` and `cargo test --quiet absolute_position_auto_margins_center_between_insets` pass (existing display_list_renderer warnings still present during test compile).
 - Pull from origin currently times out (ssh fetch). Commit `f888136` is local; push pending once network permits.
 - Push over SSH still timing out; HTTPS requires creds. Origin reset to SSH. Commits `f888136` and `d47eb9a` remain local.
+- Archived local commits as patches in `local_patches/` (0001- delegate PositionedLayout absolute helper, 0002- note pull timeout, 0003- note push blockage) so others can apply while pushes are blocked. Latest commit `837bd65` adds these files. Push over SSH still timing out; HTTPS requires creds.
 - Added aria-label/aria-labelledby no-op regressions: aria attributes do not change display/visibility (`aria_label_does_not_change_display`, `aria_labelledby_does_not_hide`).
 - Added display-list regression for `color-mix()` backgrounds: srgb/srgb-linear mixes and currentColor participation render to the resolved color (`paint_color_mix_display_list_test.rs`).
 - Added counter-style fallback regressions for out-of-range lower-greek/lower-armenian counters falling back to decimal markers.
