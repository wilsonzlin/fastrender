 - Pull/push to origin have been failing (SSH timeouts/HTTPS creds). A full patch series for all local commits lives in `local_patches/` (0001–0018) so others can apply while pushes are blocked.
 - Fixed display-list underline currentColor test to assert resolved color/thickness and remove unused vars; warnings cleared.
 - PositionedLayout absolute helper delegates to AbsoluteLayout for spec-accurate shrink-to-fit/auto-margin handling; positioned layout tests updated (shrink-to-fit expectation) and an auto-margin centering regression added. `cargo test --quiet test_absolute_position_left_right_shrink_to_fit` and `cargo test --quiet absolute_position_auto_margins_center_between_insets` pass.
-- ::marker coverage improved: property-filtering regressions ensure markers ignore box/background sizing/padding overrides and allow text-affecting properties; marker gap asserted for horizontal LTR (inline-end), horizontal RTL (inline-start), and vertical-lr (block-end) margins, ignoring block-axis margins.

 - Pull from origin currently times out (ssh fetch). Commit `f888136` is local; push pending once network permits.
 - Push over SSH still timing out; HTTPS requires creds. Origin reset to SSH. Commits `f888136` and `d47eb9a` remain local.
